## 1. Testing My Twttr
**Goal:** Write tests for a function that removes vowels from text.  
**Key Concepts:** Unit testing, function design, test case structure.

**What I learned:**
- Even small programs benefit from being **modular** and **testable**.
- **Global variables** can interfere with testing and output if not handled properly.
- Unit testing helps catch subtle issues early and forces clearer logic design.

🧠 *"Unit testing is like a second pair of eyes on your logic."*

## 2. Back to the Bank
**Goal:** Test a function that returns a response cost based on user greetings.  
**Key Concepts:** String matching, `.startswith()`, refactoring.

**What I learned:**
- The task was simple but reinforced the value of **clean input processing**.
- Having clear function logic made test writing quick and straightforward.
- It’s satisfying when test cases pass on the first try especially when you’ve structured things cleanly.

🧠 *"Sometimes simplicity is proof of growth."*

## 3. Refueling
**Goal:** Convert a fraction input like `"3/4"` into a fuel percentage.  
**Key Concepts:** Input validation, exception handling, test-driven restructuring.

**What I learned:**
- Structuring your code **for testability** might mean refactoring even if your original code “worked.”
- Edge cases like `0/0`, division by zero, and improper formats are **crucial** in robust programs.
- Knowing the logic helped, but writing tests made weak spots visible.

🧠 *"Test cases aren't just about passing, they're about seeing your blind spots."*

## 4. Re-requesting a Vanity Plate
**Goal:** Write tests for a previously written vanity plate validation function.  
**Key Concepts:** Test refactoring, condition coverage, maintaining logic clarity.

**What I learned:**
- This problem didn’t introduce new logic but emphasized **code clarity and coverage**.
- It tested my ability to make a function **reusable and testable** without rewriting it completely.
- Though it felt like a drag, finishing it reinforced that **good habits take repetition**.

🧠 *"Not every task is thrilling, but every one shapes a better coder."*

## ✅ Final Reflection: Problem Set 5

This problem set wasn’t just about solving problems it was about **refining my craft** and definitely **it was a mindset shift.**

Unit testing challenged me to shift from “does it work?” to **“is it reliable, readable, and reusable?”**  
I had to refactor, rethink structure, and anticipate errors *before* they appeared ...a mindset I’m proud to be developing.

Writing unit tests taught me the beauty of **intentional structure**, the cost of sloppy globals, and the freedom that comes with modular design. I learned how test-driven thinking isn't just for large systems, it's for anyone who wants their code to scale, grow, and survive refactors.I also learned that **testing isn't the enemy of creativity, it's the safety net that lets you build bolder**.

I'm beginning to see how powerful clean code and test coverage are in the long run.And hey, if you're not testing your code you're just **hoping for the best-case scenario** in a worst-case world. 😅🧪


**Problem Set 5? Tried. Tested. No bugs found. 🐛💨**

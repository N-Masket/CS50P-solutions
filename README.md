# CS50P Problem Sets – Nyasha Masket

Welcome to my CS50P journey! 🎓  
This repository contains my personal solutions to Harvard's **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)**.  
I've organized each problem set in a way that reflects my learning progress, understanding of Python concepts, and approach to problem-solving throughout the course.

Each problem set is placed in its own folder (e.g., `problem_set_0`, `problem_set_1`), and inside each of those, you’ll find subfolders for the individual tasks, each containing a solution file (e.g., `meal.py`, `indoor.py`). This structure helps keep everything tidy and easy to follow.
📁 problem_set_0/
├── indoor/
│ └── indoor.py
└── playback/
└── playback.py

📁 problem_set_1/
├── meal/
│ └── meal.py
└── interpreter/
└── interpreter.py

## 📚 Notes & Reflections

I’m documenting what I learn as I go through each problem set. These notes include key concepts, challenges I faced, my approach, and lessons learned.

- [📝 Problem Set 0 Notes](problem_set_0/NOTES.md)
- [📝 Problem Set 1 Notes](problem_set_1/NOTES.md) _(coming soon)_
- [📝 Problem Set 2 Notes](problem_set_2/NOTES.md)

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

CS50P is teaching me to think more clearly, write cleaner code, and approach problems with curiosity rather than fear. Each challenge pushes me to break problems down, explore Python’s tools, and learn how to communicate my logic not just to a computer, but to others who read my code. I'm learning to trust the process, embrace mistakes, and get better with every line I write.
